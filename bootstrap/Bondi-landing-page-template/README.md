# Bondi a Landing page Template

Landing page template using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap5

## Description

This is my implementation of a landing page template made by Graphberry using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 before watching another developer on youtube doing the same template, as a review of my code so I can learn more from the process I used his live website version as a reference, not the PSD template from the Graphberry website because his version has all the images I needed to complete the design without the need to search for all the images again.
